# Ultrack_experimental
Ultrack is my simple idea of how it is possible to make drag (flip / swip) interaction more responsive on a normal touchscreen through means of traditional algorithms which engage little computing resources.

Here below is the picture of the sample application that is equipped with the first experimental version of Ultrack. You can find the .apk file above. Feel free to contact me if there's any advice or trouble. The idea was made possible thanks to Kodular!
